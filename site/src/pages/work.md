### Interests

I'm very interested in game development. When I have free time, I  like to make 3D models in tools like Blender that I could eventually use when making a video game. I'm actively spending time learning other tools involved in game development like FL Studio for creating music. I plan to start actively developing a game over the holidays when I'll have more freetime. In addition to this, I like to spend time drawing and writing short stories for fun.

I'm also interested in computer hardware. In highschool, I built a PC from parts I found in thrift stores and ordered online. I also opened up and repaired an ultrabook laptop after spilling water on the keyboard. These experiences were a lot of fun for me and increased my passion for the hardware side of computing.


### Future Plans

#### Education

I'm planning on graduating with Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (with a minor in Psychology) from Allegheny College in May 2024. After that, I would like to attend graduate school. I'm planning on applying to Carnegie Mellon University in the 3 + 2 program through Allegheny College. If accepted to this, I would start there in the Fall 2023 semester. I would graduate at the end of the Fall 2024 semester and earn a Bachelor's degree at the same time as a Master of Information Systems Management. If this plan doesn't work out, I would still like to go to grad school in the future while working in industry.

#### Career

I'm interested in pursuing a career in Computer Science. Specifically, I would like to work as either a Software Engineer or a Hardware Engineer. Since both of these fields excite me so much, I would be perfectly happy working to contribute anything I can to bring the world of personal computing into the future.
